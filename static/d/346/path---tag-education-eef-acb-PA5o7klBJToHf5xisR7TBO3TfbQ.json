Itemized lists\nlook like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>this one</li>\n<li>that one</li>\n<li>the other one</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text\ncontent starts at 4-columns in.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Block quotes are\nwritten like so.</p>\n<p>They can span multiple paragraphs,\nif you like.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., \"it's all\nin chapters 12--14\"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.\nUnicode is supported. ☺</p>\n<h2>An h2 header</h2>\n<p>Here's a numbered list:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>first item</li>\n<li>second item</li>\n<li>third item</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters\nfrom the left side). Here's a code sample:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"python\"><pre class=\"language-python\"><code class=\"language-python\"><span class=\"token comment\"># Let me re-iterate ...</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">for</span> i <span class=\"token keyword\">in</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span> <span class=\"token number\">10</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> do<span class=\"token operator\">-</span>something<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>i<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of\nindenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\">define <span class=\"token function\">foobar</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    print <span class=\"token string\">\"Welcome to flavor country!\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>(which makes copying &#x26; pasting easier). You can optionally mark the\ndelimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"python\"><pre class=\"language-python\"><code class=\"language-python\"><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> time\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Quick, count to ten!</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">for</span> i <span class=\"token keyword\">in</span> <span class=\"token builtin\">range</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">10</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\"># (but not *too* quick)</span>\n    time<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>sleep<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">0.5</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">print</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>i<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre></div>\n<h3>An h3 header</h3>\n<p>Now a nested list:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>First, get these ingredients:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>carrots</li>\n<li>celery</li>\n<li>lentils</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Boil some water.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dump everything in the pot and follow\nthis algorithm:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">find wooden spoon\nuncover pot\nstir\ncover pot\nbalance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle\nwait 10 minutes\ngoto first step (or shut off burner when done)</code></pre></div>\n<p>Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Image with Alt</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21834/34442433-6afc7594-ecc2-11e7-9277-c4a6602a3067.png\" alt=\"Alt text of the image\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Welcoming to write third post","slug":"welcoming-post-third","tags":[{"frontmatter":{"name":"education","slug":"education"}}],"feature_image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":null,"aspectRatio":null,"src":null,"srcSet":null,"sizes":null}}},"author":{"frontmatter":{"name":"Akansh Gulati","profile_image":"/images/authors/akansh.png"}}},"excerpt":"This article is about different typography which are supported in the post section of the blog. \nBelow you can see the various headings…"}},{"node":{"id":"d9ef705c-c2d1-5773-9e27-2e25e68486cf","html":"<p>This week we’ll <strong>take</strong> a look at all the steps required to make astonishing coffee with a Chemex at home. The Chemex Coffeemaker is a manual, pour-over style glass-container coffeemaker that Peter Schlumbohm invented in 1941, and which continues to be manufactured by the Chemex Corporation in Chicopee, Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>In 1958, designers at the <a href=\"https://www.spacefarm.digital\" target=\"_blank\">Illinois Institute of Technology</a> said that the Chemex Coffeemaker is <em>\"one of the best-designed products of modern times\"</em>, and so is included in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.</p>\n<h2>The little secrets of Chemex brewing</h2>\n<p>The Chemex Coffeemaker consists of an hourglass-shaped glass flask with a conical funnel-like neck (rather than the cylindrical neck of an Erlenmeyer flask) and uses proprietary filters, made of bonded paper (thicker-gauge paper than the standard paper filters for a drip-method coffeemaker) that removes most of the coffee oils, brewing coffee with a taste that is different than coffee brewed in other coffee-making systems; also, the thicker paper of the Chemex coffee filters may assist in removing cafestol, a cholesterol-containing compound found in coffee oils. Here’s three important tips newbies forget about:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Always buy dedicated Chemex filters.</li>\n<li>Use a scale, don’t try to eyeball it.</li>\n<li>Never skip preheating the glass.</li>\n<li>Timing is key, don’t forget the clock.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The most visually distinctive feature of the Chemex is the heatproof wooden collar around the neck, allowing it to be handled and poured when full of hot water. This is turned, then split in two to allow it to fit around the glass neck. The two pieces are held loosely in place by a tied leather thong. The pieces are not tied tightly and can still move slightly, retained by the shape of the conical glass.</p>\n<p>For a design piece that became popular post-war at a time of Modernism and precision manufacture, this juxtaposition of natural wood and the organic nature of a hand-tied knot with the laboratory nature of glassware was a distinctive feature of its appearance.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Welcoming to write second post","slug":"welcoming-post-second","tags":[{"frontmatter":{"name":"education","slug":"education"}}],"feature_image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":null,"aspectRatio":null,"src":null,"srcSet":null,"sizes":null}}},"author":{"frontmatter":{"name":"Akansh Gulati","profile_image":"/images/authors/akansh.png"}}},"excerpt":"This week we’ll take a look at all the steps required to make astonishing coffee with a Chemex at home.
